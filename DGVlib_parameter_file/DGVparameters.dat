! Model threshholds: The order in which the models are envoked are 
! 1) the Boltzmann equation, non-split formulation 
! 2) the Boltzmann equation, split f=f_M + df, formulation
! 3) the linearized Boltzmann equation (unless solving spatially homogeneous problem, does not give an advantage)
! 4) the BGK-type Model with velocity dependent collision frequency
! 5) the ES-BGK/BGK or Shakhov model
! 
! the parameters below define the thresholds for switching between models. They represent the maximum allowed values of the L1-norm of the 
! deviation of the solution from the local maxwellian. When the L1-norm of the deviation drops below the treshhold, the appropriate model is envoked. 
! NOTICE: keep linear_lev at least an order of magnitude less than decomp_lev
!
! VERY IMPORTANT: the tresholds for the models above should be given in decreasing order. 
! Otherwise the algorithms will make a mistake.

ESBGK modifier = -0.5          !! alpha for prandtl number, -0.5 corresponds to 2/3 , 0 to BGK if ES model is used. 
use VSS diam in relax rates = no !! flag_use_VSS_diam ! if the value supplied is "yes", relaxation rates for the moments are computed using the reference diameter of the variable hard shperes model. if no, then the hard shperes ref diameter is used.

!! Parameters VD-BGK (BGK model with velocity dependent collision frequency
N of enforced moments = 6       !! Order -- the variable determining how many or the built-in moments are enforced in relaxation
!	                	        !! order=1 invokes the first enforced moment. Current allowed Maximum is 15 moments total
N of coefficients in VDCF = 6   !! Order_nu -- the number of coefficients/basis functions in the representation of the velocity-dependent collision

                                    ! we will send chunks of the linearized operator to a selected group of processors and will try to compute it there
                                    ! presumably, we can save on communication by doing that. 
number of mpi copies of A = 3! num_Acopies -- this is to keep the number of copies of A distributed between the MPI processors.
